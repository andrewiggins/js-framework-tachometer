- Fill in Readme & CONTRIBUTING
- Add ability to create different benchmarks other than js-framework-benchmarks
- Consider how to configure tachometer differently for different benchmarks (e.g. warmups required)
- Frameworks to consider:
	- vue-next
	- svelte
	- lit-html
	- react
	- glimmer
	- ng-ivy
- `runNpm`: Parse npm output into just what's meaningful
- If necessary, restrict number of concurrent build/install tasks to number of cores available - 1 (for master process)
